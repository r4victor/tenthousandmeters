    <h1>Python behind the scenes: a list of resources</h1>
    <hr />
    
    <p>This is a collection of documents, posts and talks that I found useful while studying CPython and working on the <a href="/tag/python-behind-the-scenes/">CPython behind the scenes</a> series. There are some really good resources, but I couldn't find answers to many of my questions. That's why I eventually decided to share my own experience of working through the CPython's source code.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/">Python Documentation</a>. Python documentation is the first place to go to for almost any Python-related topic. While it lacks a special part covering internals of the interpreter, <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/c-api/index.html">Python/C API reference</a> describes CPython's public interfaces and some of the implementation details. It's accompanied by <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/extending/index.html#extending-index">the tutorial for C programmers</a>, which shows how to extend a Python program with C or to embed Python inside a C application. I bet you'll understand how CPython works quite well just by accomplishing thoughtfully one of these tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/">PEPs</a>. You won't find a PEP that describes the overall design of the interpreter, but most of the major changes to the language have a corresponding proposal. PEPs are great. They provide you with both technical and historical contexts. Authors of documentation have a good habit of referencing a relevant PEP when appropriate. For example, Python/C API reference mentions at least once <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0432/">PEP 432</a> that describes a transition to a new CPython initialization sequence and <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0587/">PEP 587</a>, which is its partial implementation.</p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://leanpub.com/insidethepythonvirtualmachine">Inside The Python Virtual Machine</a> book by Obi Ike-Nwosu. The most comprehensive and, as I can judge, accurate source on the CPython internals.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/extending/index.html#extending-index">Your Guide to the CPython Source Code</a> by Anthony Shaw. The post's title speaks for itself. If you want to dig into the source code straight away, this should be your choice!</li>
<li><a href="https://tech.blog.aknin.name/category/my-projects/pythons-innards/">Pythonâ€™s Innards series</a> by Yaniv Aknin. Covers the early versions of the CPython 3 VM.</li>
<li><a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/tag/python-internals">Python internals</a> posts by Eli Bendersky. The posts covering symbol tables are especially good.</li>
<li><a href="http://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-python-interpreter-written-in-python.html">A Python Interpreter Written in Python</a> by Allison Kaptur. The article describes a toy Python VM that is able to execute real Python bytecode. It might be useful as a first indroduction to the interpreter. I don't see a good reason, though, to spend much time studing a toy example when CPython itself is not overwhelmingly complicated.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RlqbHCCVyc">To GIL or not to GIL</a> talk by Eric Snow. The main theme of the talk is subinterpretes. What I like about it is how Eric gives an overview of CPython architecture in the beginning.</li>
