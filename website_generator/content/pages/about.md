Title: about

Hello! I'm Victor. I love to explore complex systems and hard-to-grasp ideas and explain them in a simple way. This website is a place to share my explanations with everyone.

I wrote the [Python behind the scenes]({tag}/Python behind the scenes) series, which is a dive into the internals of CPython, Python's interpreter.

Currently, I'm working on [dstack](https://github.com/dstackai/dstack), an exciting project in the GPU clouds / ML space. Think Terraform + Kubernetes for AI.

## Consulting

I'm a product-minded software engineer. My go-to tech stack is Python/Go, but I'm open to pick up the right tool for the job.
I'm open for opportunities. Drop me a message if you have something interesting to work or collaborate on.
