Title: about

Hello! I'm Victor. I love to explore complex systems and hard-to-grasp ideas and explain them in a simple way. This website is a place to share my explanations with everyone.

I wrote the [Python behind the scenes]({tag}/Python behind the scenes) series, which is a dive into the internals of CPython, Python's interpreter.

Another project of mine is [bestresourcestolearnx.com](https://bestresourcestolearnx.com/). I share there my favourite learning resources (books, articles, videos, courses, etc) on programming and other IT-related topics.
