Hello! I'm Victor. I love to explore complex systems and hard-to-grasp ideas and explain them in a simple way. This website is a place to share my explanations with everyone.

I wrote the [Python behind the scenes]({tag}/Python behind the scenes) series, which is a dive into the internals of CPython, Python's interpreter.

Another project of mine is [bestresourcestolearnx.com](https://bestresourcestolearnx.com/), where I share my favourite learning resources (books, articles, videos, courses, etc) on programming and other IT-related topics.

Here's [my github](https://github.com/r4victor).

## Consulting

I'm a product-minded software engineer. I find technical (and non-technical) solutions to business problems. My go-to tech stack is Python, but I'm open to pick up the right tool for the job.

I'm always open for opportunities. Drop me a message if you have something interesting to work/collaborate on.
