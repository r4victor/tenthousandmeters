Hello! I'm Victor. I love to explore complex systems and hard-to-grasp ideas and explain them in a simple way. This website is a place to share my explanations with everyone.

I wrote the [Python behind the scenes]({tag}/Python behind the scenes) series, which is a dive into the internals of CPython, Python's interpreter.

Currently, I'm working on [dstack](https://github.com/dstackai/dstack).
It's an exciting project in the GPU clouds / ML space. Think Terraform + Kubernetes for AI.

## Consulting

I'm a product-minded software engineer. I find technical (and non-technical) solutions to business problems. My go-to tech stack is Python, but I'm open to pick up the right tool for the job.

I'm always open for opportunities. Drop me a message if you have something interesting to work/collaborate on.

## Support

You can help me cover hosting expenses by signing up on [DigitalOcean with my referral link](https://m.do.co/c/fb3a14e82e13). You'll get $100 in credit, and I'll get $25. Another lucrative way to help is to buy a domain on [Gandi.net](https://gandi.link/f/ccc431ff).

Thank you!
