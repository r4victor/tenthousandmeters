Here it is: [github.com/r4victor/tenthousandmeters](https://github.com/r4victor/tenthousandmeters). It started as a private repo but now I'm making it public so that everyone can make PRs and issues and contribute. 

I'm also making updates to the blog that I haven't actively maintained since 2022 when I finished writing the [Python behind the scenes]({tag}/Python behind the scenes) series. My resolution for 2025 is to start writing again.

## What I've been up to

Last few years I've been mostly writing code and not blog posts. The project I work on is [`dstack`](https://github.com/dstackai/dstack). It's an exciting project in the GPU clouds / ML space. Think Terraform + Kubernetes for AI. And it's open source. So if you're interested in LLM inference/training or need a GPU for some other tasks, take a look!

## Reflections on blogging

I started this blog in 2020 as a home for the [Python behind the scenes]({tag}/Python behind the scenes) series. It was a very successful start that I did not anticipated. About 10 out of 13 articles appeared on the HN front page, and the blog got somewhere around 300k hits the first year. Then the [Python behind the scenes]({tag}/Python behind the scenes) series came to conclusion, and I stopped.

I absolutely loved writing in-depth technical articles. And I've got ideas for more series. How about Docker behind the scenes or Kubernetes behind the scenes? Unfortunately the reality is that longreads take so much time to write, it's almost impossible to find that time.

## Plans for 2025

I still write a lot of notes for myself when I learn new stuff. So in 2025 I'm thinking to start posting articles again in a shorter format and possibly lowering the bar of the research I conduct. Still, I want it too be very a) technical and b) accessible. I plan to cover software engineering, Python, and other areas I'm proficient in. In addition, since I'm now working in the GPU clouds / ML / LLMs space, I'll continue trying to understand what's going on there and share my findings.

Since the blog now has a public GitHub repo, which is an excellent place to collaborate, I'm adding comments in the [form of GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/r4victor/tenthousandmeters/discussions). Let's see how it works.
